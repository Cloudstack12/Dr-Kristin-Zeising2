                <h2>Definition Of Sexual Addiction Therapy</h2>
                <p>
                    Sexual addiction therapy, or sex addiction therapy, is a form of psychotherapy that helps individuals who struggle with compulsive sexual behavior. This type of therapy is designed to identify the underlying psychological, emotional, and social factors that contribute to addictive behavior and provide tools to manage and control these impulses. The therapist works with the individual to understand the root causes of their addiction and develop a treatment plan tailored to their specific needs. Sexual addiction therapy may include individual or group counseling, behavioral therapy, cognitive therapy, family therapy, and other interventions. The goal of sexual addiction therapy is to help individuals regain control of their sexual behaviors, improve their self-esteem, and rebuild healthy relationships.
